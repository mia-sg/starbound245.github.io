        My name is Mia and I'm excited to learn more about coding! I have used HTML and CSS in the past when making a blog to use
        while on my exhange year in England, but it's been so many years now.
        <br>
        One of my favourite things is to learn new languages, and at the moment I'm learning Japanese! I've been studying since March 2023
        and I'm having a lot of fun! 日本語が好きです！
