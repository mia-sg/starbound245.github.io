# Hello!

My name is Mia, and I'm excited to learn more about coding!

I have basic knowledge of html and CSS, but it's been many years since I utilised that knowledge (maybe I'll find it somewhere deep in a dusty corner of my brain once I start coding again).

I love learning languages and am currently learning Japanese on my own (I'm just moved up to JLPT L4). 日本語が好きです！
